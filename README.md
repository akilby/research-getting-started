# Getting started with research in Python and R on the HPC -- Onboarding guide for RAs

### Get an account on Northeastern's High Performance Computing cluster

Nearly everything we do will be on Northeastern's HPC (also called the Discovery cluster). There are many advantages to the cluster - it allows for terabytes of storage, has a large number of fast machines that you can run in parallel, and has all the software (and licenses) we use. It also has some disadvantages: it can be confusing, buggy, and can get overloaded. There is also a pretty significant learning curve.
