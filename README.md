# Onboarding guide for RAs

### Get an account on Northeastern's High Performance Computing cluster

Nearly everything we do will be on Northeastern's HPC (also called the Discovery cluster or the Holyoke Cluster). There are many advantages to the cluster - it allows for terabytes of storage, has a large number of fast machines that you can run in parallel, and has all the software (and licenses) we use. It also has some disadvantages: it can be confusing, buggy, and can get overloaded. There is also a pretty significant learning curve.

You need to first sign up for an account [here using ServiceNow](https://northeastern.service-now.com/research?id=nurc_category). Click `Research Computing Access Request` and fill out the form, indicating me as your sponsor. (Answer *no* to `Do you need access to the following licensed software?`)  

When you've done this, let me know as I will need to initiate approvals on my end, and have you added to my resources.
