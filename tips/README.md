## Useful Linux tips

1. You can replay a command you recently used, by pressing the up arrow

2. If you want to cancel a line you were typing and have a fresh prompt, type `ctrl-c`

3. If you want to search for an often-used command, type `ctrl-r` and start typing the command. For example, at the login prompt, try, `ctrl-r srun` and hit enter when you see the one you want to use, to avoid retyping the full command
